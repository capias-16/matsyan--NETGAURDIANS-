PhantomNet SAR Detection DashboardProject DescriptionThe PhantomNet SAR Detection Dashboard is a real-time monitoring system designed to detect and track ghost nets (abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data. This application provides a comprehensive overview of active SAR satellites, recent ghost net detections, an interactive map of detection locations, and a history of exported reports. It acts as a central command center for ocean conservation efforts, providing real-time insights into the health of our marine environment.Problem StatementGhost nets pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems, leading to "ghost fishing" where marine life gets entangled and dies. They also damage coral reefs and other critical habitats. Traditional methods of detecting these nets are often inefficient and costly. This project aims to leverage SAR technology to provide a more efficient, scalable, and real-time solution for identifying and managing ghost net pollution, contributing to ocean conservation efforts.Installation & Setup InstructionsPrerequisites:Node.js (LTS version recommended)npm (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js) or YarnSteps:Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/matsyan--NETGAURDIANS-.git
